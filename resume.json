I also ensured robust endpoint security measures across Text Request. I handled the configuration of various SaaS software applications, which involved procurement, license management, and setting default security parameters. My duties extended to managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) processes throughout Text Request. I navigated various IAM solutions, such as Azure AD and Google Business, alongside one-off logins that do not allow SSO. To optimize efficiency, I spearheaded efforts to consolidate and streamline these solutions, favoring Azure AD or a combination of Azure AD and Google when necessary. Furthermore, I was pivotal in constructing monitoring and alert dashboards for proactive IT oversight. I worked closely with department heads to identify existing processes, leveraging IT solutions to simplify operations and enhance productivity, saving valuable time company-wide. I maintain our SOC2 Type 2 compliance and work directly with our auditors to ensure a successful audit.",
